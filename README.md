# TOXIC COMMENT PROJECT
# ABOUT DATASET

In this repository, I'm working on a Toxic comment classification project - It's a multi-label classification (It basically means, each comment can belong to more than one category)  For example, an article can belong to deep learning and NLP..

In this dataset, We are provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior.

The types of toxicity are: 

<strong>toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate.</strong>

# IMPLEMENTATION 
In this repository, I'm classifying the labels using LSTM technique with the help of tensorflow framework.

1] Data pre-processing :

First, Using NLTK library for stopwords and stemmer.
<p>
<strong> STEMMER </strong>
  
Stemming is a simpler version  where we are interested in stripping the suffix at the end of the word. When stemming we are interesting in reducing the inflected or derived word to it's base form.

inflections: adding a suffix to a word, that doesn't change its grammatical category, such as tenses in verbs (-ing, -ed, -s), plural in nouns (s).

derivations - adding a suffix to a word, that changes its grammatical category, such as nation (noun) => national (adjective) => nationalize (verb).</p>

Updation in progress...
